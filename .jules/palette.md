# Palette UX Journal - CMMC Compliance Platform

This journal tracks critical UX and accessibility learnings for the CMMC Compliance Platform.

## 2026-03-26 - Visual scannability for Markdown reports
**Learning:** In a backend-heavy system where the primary interface for human stakeholders is a generated Markdown report, visual scannability is paramount. Adding status emojis and progress bars significantly improves the "at-a-glance" understanding of compliance posture.
**Action:** Always include visual progress indicators and status emojis in human-readable reports (Markdown/PDF/CSV).

## 2026-03-27 - Visual Scannability in Markdown Reports
**Learning:** Dense text reports like the System Security Plan (SSP) are difficult to scan for high-level status. Using familiar visual metaphors like emojis (✅/🟡/🛑), star ratings (⭐⭐⭐), and block-based progress bars (█░) significantly improves information density and "at-a-glance" comprehension in non-interactive formats like Markdown.
**Action:** Always consider adding visual markers (emojis, progress bars) to text-based reports to highlight critical status and progress metrics.

## 2026-03-28 - Consistent Visual Density & Informative Truncation
**Learning:** Visual scannability is easily broken by inconsistent padding (e.g., variable-length star ratings). Providing consistent visual density (star padding) and explicit feedback for truncated content (clear notices) ensures the user is never confused about the completeness or status of the data.
**Action:** Always pad visual ratings to a consistent width and provide clear, actionable notices when data is intentionally truncated in summaries.
